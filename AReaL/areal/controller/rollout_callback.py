class RolloutCallback:
    """Callback interface for train workers to coordinate with TrainController.

    This class acts as a proxy that train engines use to trigger operations on
    the inference side via HTTP callbacks to the TrainController. The controller
    then forwards these to the RolloutController.

    IMPORTANT: Methods that return Future must be non-blocking to avoid deadlocks.
    NCCL operations are collective - both train and inference sides must participate
    concurrently. If these methods blocked, the train side couldn't start its NCCL
    operations while waiting for the inference side, causing a deadlock.
